definition: >
  A composite number is a natural number greater than 1 that can be expressed
  as the product of two natural numbers greater than 1.

  Formally, a number n is composite if and only if there exist natural numbers
  a and b such that a > 1, b > 1, and n = a × b.

  Composite numbers have more than two distinct positive divisors.

  The numbers 0 and 1 are neither prime nor composite.
  Negative numbers and non-integer values are outside the domain of this concept.
