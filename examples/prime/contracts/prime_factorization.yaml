contract: prime_factorization
version: v1

inputs:
  n:
    concept: natural_number

outputs:
  factors:
    concept: prime_factorization

guarantees:
  semantic:
    - >
      The output factors form a prime_factorization of [n].
    - >
      The product of all elements in factors equals [n].
    - >
      Every element in factors is a prime_number.
    - >
      The factors are ordered in non-decreasing order.

  domain:
    - >
      This contract is defined only for natural numbers n >= 2.

  uniqueness:
    - >
      For any valid input n, the prime_factorization is unique.

acceptance:
  examples:
    - >
      For n = 12, factors = [2, 2, 3].
    - >
      For n = 13, factors = [13].
