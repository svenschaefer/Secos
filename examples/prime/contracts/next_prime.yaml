contract: next_prime
version: v1

inputs:
  n:
    concept: natural_number

outputs:
  p:
    concept: prime_number

guarantees:
  semantic:
    - >
      The output p is a prime_number.
    - >
      p is strictly greater than the input n.
    - >
      For any prime_number q where q > n, p <= q.

  domain:
    - >
      This contract is defined for all natural numbers n >= 0.

  minimality:
    - >
      p is the smallest prime_number greater than n.

acceptance:
  examples:
    - >
      For n = 3, p = 5.
    - >
      For n = 10, p = 11.
