contract: is_prime
version: v2

domain:
  inputs_must_satisfy:
    - natural_number
  total: true

inputs:
  number:
    concept: natural_number

outputs:
  is_prime:
    type: boolean

guarantees:
  semantic:
    - >
      For any input value that satisfies the concept [natural_number],
      the contract determines whether the value satisfies the concept [prime_number].

    - >
      If the input value does not satisfy the concept [natural_number],
      the behavior of this contract is undefined and outside the scope of this contract.

    - >
      The contract is deterministic: identical valid inputs always yield identical outputs.

acceptance:
  - scenario: Prime numbers are identified correctly
    given: number satisfies the concept [prime_number]
    then: is_prime is true

  - scenario: Composite numbers are not prime
    given: number satisfies the concept [composite_number]
    then: is_prime is false
