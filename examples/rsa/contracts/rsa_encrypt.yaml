contract: rsa_encrypt
version: v1

inputs:
  key:
    concept: rsa_public_key
  message:
    concept: plaintext

outputs:
  encrypted:
    concept: ciphertext

guarantees:
  semantic:
    - >
      The output encrypted is the RSA encryption of message
      under the provided rsa_public_key.
    - >
      For a given key and message, the encryption result is deterministic.

  domain:
    - >
      This contract is defined only if the plaintext message
      is within the valid numeric range of the key modulus.

assumptions:
  - >
    No padding scheme, randomness, or probabilistic behavior
    is implied by this contract.
