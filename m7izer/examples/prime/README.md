# Prime Number Example

This example demonstrates how a simple mathematical concept and contract
are expressed using Concepts and Contracts.

## Concept
- `prime_number`: defines the meaning of a prime number.

## Contract
- `is_prime`: guarantees the determination of whether a given number
  satisfies the concept `prime_number`.

This example is intentionally minimal and focuses on semantic clarity.
